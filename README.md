# Side Effect Workspace

This workspace contains several packages that facilitate testing blocs that produce side effects. The main packages are:

- **side_effect_cubit**: This package introduces the concept of side effects in a bloc, allowing for more flexible and modular state management.
- **side_effect_cubit_test**: This package is designed to test blocs that produce side effects, inheriting from the bloc_test package and adding features for expecting side effects to be emitted.
